# Renewable Energy Development

## Introduction
I'm a Data Product Manager at a renewable energy development company in NYC, passionate about leveraging coding and data analysis to drive insights and innovation in the energy sector and beyond. This repository showcases my coding skills in SQL, Python, and R, with a focus on geospatial analysis and data engineering.


## Projects
### Project 1: Market Supply Charge Rate Extraction
Description: This project involves the extraction of market supply charge rates from a large number of PDF documents provided by an energy utility company. The PDF documents, which are accessible via hyperlinks on the Con Edison website, contain unstructured data in the form of tables and text. Using Python and the pdfplumber library, I developed a script to automate the extraction of relevant information from the PDFs. The script reads the PDF content, identifies the sections of interest using pattern matching techniques, and applies data extraction methods to capture the market supply charge rates. As the data is unstructured, additional preprocessing and cleaning steps are performed to transform it into structured format, enabling further analysis, reporting, and integration with other systems. This project showcases my ability to work with unstructured data and utilize PDF parsing techniques to extract valuable insights related to market supply charge rates in the energy sector.

### Project 2:  Parcel Data Comparison and Analysis
Description: This project involves the comparison and analysis of parcel data for potential projects. The script reads two CSV files: the original table containing a list of parcels for potential projects and a new table after refining the query parameters. The script performs data merging and comparison operations to identify the differences between the two datasets. It removes a specified column from both tables and merges them based on common columns. The resulting merged dataset highlights the parcels from the original table, indicating that they have potentially been previously reviewed. The script then generates an Excel file where the highlighted parcels are visually differentiated, allowing the receiver of the table to easily identify the parcels they have potentially already examined and observe the changes made with the new parameters. This project showcases my skills in data manipulation, merging, and generating visual outputs for effective data analysis and presentation in the context of parcel data for potential projects.
